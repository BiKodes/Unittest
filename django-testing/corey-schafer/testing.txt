---When you write good test for your code it gives you more confidence that your updates and refactoring
    don't have any unintended consequences or break your code in any way.

----All tests have to be named properly so as to be run, they must start with the name 'test*.py'. Your tests 
    should be good enough to catch mistakes.

---Mocking can be used mostly when accessing thinngs that are out of your control like urls.

---Tests should be isolated, hence a test should not relay on other tests or affect another tests.s
